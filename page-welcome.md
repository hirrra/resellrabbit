# 2 Minute Onboarding
Welcome! This is everything you need to know before you start.

🐰  Please first ensure that the ResellRabbit [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/poshmark-resellrabbit/cabihlkfnpoabedklembenkejcajkphe){:target="_blank"} is installed.

## Here's how to use our tool

- 💻 Login to [poshmark.com](https://poshmark.com/){:target="_blank"} 
- 👚 Go to your Poshmark closet
- 🕒 Schedule when you want to share your closet using ResellRabbit
- ☕ Voila! Go check emails, watch Netflix, grab lunch! 

## Things to keep in mind

#### Share ban
Sharing excessively can lead to temporary share ban, **please be cautious**. You can set a custom daily share limit in the settings as a preventative measure. 

#### Make sure ResellRabbit can do its tasks
ResellRabbit will only work when there's a tab open on your closet page. We recommend leaving your Poshmark closet tab open on its own window in the background, and enabling _Keep computer awake_ mode if you plan to step away.

#### We respect your privacy
ResellRabbit does **not** view or save any of your Poshmark-related data. In other words, your Poshmark password, bank account information, and even your closet name is safe and stays in Poshmark -- we don't need or even _want_ to know it!

#### Your feedback is valuable (truly!)
If you have any concerns or suggestions, [please contact us at resellrabbit@gmail.com](mailto:resellrabbit@gmail.com?subject=[Feedback]). This helps us make the tool better for you and others!
