# 2 Minute Onboarding
Welcome! This is everything you need to know before you start.

## Here's how to use our tool

- 🐰 Install the ResellRabbit [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/poshmark-resellrabbit/cabihlkfnpoabedklembenkejcajkphe){:target="_blank"} 
- 💻 Login to [poshmark.com](https://poshmark.com/){:target="_blank"} 
- 👚 Go to your Poshmark closet
- 🕒 Schedule when you want to share your closet using ResellRabbit
- ✅ Leave the tab open, and turn on _Prevent computer sleep_ if you plan to step away
- ☕ Voila! Go check emails, watch Netflix, grab lunch! 

## A couple things to keep in mind

#### Share jail
Sharing excessively can lead to temporary share jail, **please be cautious**. You can set a custom daily share limit in the settings as a preventative measure. We recommend sharing up to an average of 300 listings per hour.

#### We respect your privacy
ResellRabbit does **not** save any of your Poshmark-related data. In other words, your Poshmark password, bank account information, and even your closet name is safe and secure -- we don't need or even _want_ to know it!

#### Your feedback is valuable (truly!)
If you have any concerns or suggestions, [please let us know](mailto:resellrabbit@gmail.com?subject=[Feedback]). This helps us make the tool better for you and others!
