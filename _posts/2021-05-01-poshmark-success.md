After you've selected high quality items to sell, listed them with clear photos and key words, you may think you're done. But the magic really happens with outreach. I can confidently guarantee that if you follow these strategies I outline below, you _will sell faster_.

## Share, share, share

### What is sharing and why is it worth talking about?

The MOST important thing that impacts your sales is how often you share your items. You can share your item by selecting the little arrow icon at the bottom of your listings. What this does is it boosts your listing to the top of search results since results are listed by "Just Shared" by default. If you're selling a yellow satin slip dress and recently shared it, then someone who searched for "slip dress yellow" likely will find your item at the top of their search results. 


### Proof that sharing makes a difference

Part-time reseller Hannah Alonzo did an experiment where she shared every 30 minutes from 9am to 10pm on a Sunday while the next day she didn't share a single time. She had 128 listings at the time. I suggest [you watch her video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z42vWCscwaY) since it has more details and a walkthrough of all her results, but this is the main takeaway: On the day she consistently shared throughout the day, she made **3 sales** and **37 likes**. On the day she didn't share, she made **0 sales** and **4 likes**.

She also published a [followup video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5pSliW8Uok) where she stopped sharing altogether for an entire week. That week, she made **3 sales** and got **18 likes**. The next week when she shared ~9 times a day, she made **14 sales** and got **142 likes**. _Yowzas._ If her items were $20 on average, then she would've earned **~$220 more in a week just from sharing**. Her sales **increased by 460%** just by sharing her listings.

### Use automation services

***So many*** resellers on Poshmark use automation services, but technically bots or plugins are not allowed by Poshmark so a lot of people feel strongly in one way or another about this topic. It's important to talk about.

When resellers get to hundreds or even thousands of listings posted in their closet, they're obligated to spend hours a day just sharing. If resellers spend the time sourcing, listing, and managing these items, should they be punished for having such a large closet?

Sharing hundreds and sometimes even thousands listings requires so much time spent for mindless, monotonous, tedious, repetitive clicking of buttons over, and over, and over again. Sellers are complex and brilliant humans and should not be required to spend hours of their day doing something so mind numbing. 

So it makes sense for sellers to look for solutions to save themselves from spending so much time doing this.

### Why does Poshmark even have the sharing system?

Poshmark's claim for creating the sharing system is to even the playing field for sellers, unlike Ebay or Etsy where sellers who pay for promotions or are more experienced are favored. The sharing system also forces sellers to continuously return to the app because, surprise, more activity on the app will lead to more sales which leads to more commission for Poshmark.


### What are the risks of using bots?

Poshmark today as it stands doesn't commit a lot of resources in tracking down those who use bots or punishing them. The worst that can happen is your shares are silenced, or you're put in "share jail" temporarily where you can't share for <24 hours. Some people however have mentioned it's possible for Poshmark to ban your account for abusive sharing. I suggest anyone using bots share conservatively and stay under 5000 shares max.

n the end, tracking and banning sellers who use bots will discourage sellers from using the platform, and that hurts the bottom line for Poshmark.

### Are there alternatives to using a bot?

The one alternative to not having to share yourself is by hiring out a VA (virtual assistant) from places like [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/) or even Instagram. There are, however, a couple things to note before deciding to do so. 

**Pros:**
- You save time
- You get to delegate out the tasks you don't like doing

**Cons:**
- **Putting your account at risk:** You have to give another person your login information. This means they could change your password, delete your all your listings, or change your bank information so all your money you earned gets sent to their bank account. Is it likely to happen? Probably not, but you certainly run that risk when you give someone your login information.
- **Managerial tasks:** When you hire someone as a VA, you've then got an employee and take the responsibilities of a manager. You have to make sure your employee is doing their job and motivate them or reprimand them if they're not meeting expectations. This also may include training the person so they're knowledgeable about Poshmark. For example if you want to teach someone to crosslist, you'll need to teach the differences between multiple platforms.
- **Constant interaction:** Whether via email or text, you still have to interact with them frequently and that may not be what you like to do as a reseller.
- **Mistakes:** VAs can also make mistakes, which means you may still have to put in the time to review their work.
- **Tax complications:** If you're hiring a VA for the long-haul, then your taxes will get more difficult. If taxes are not your favorite thing to do, take into consideration you'll make it harder by hiring someone.

You could also find a niece/nephew, friend, or anyone trustworthy with more time who may be willing to share your closet. But it's unknown how consistently they will share or continue sharing.
