## Learn how to market your pieces 

There are a lot of ways you can perfect the art of listing products on Poshmark. Here's a brief overview of what to keep in mind. 

1. Prepare the garments for a good photoshoot. Steam out any wrinkles and use a lint-roller to pick up pet hairs.
2. Figure out what works best for you and the particular garment: flat-lay, hanging, or modeling the item. For example, if you're selling a jacket and it's too large, then modeling the jacket may make it look overly clunky and not flattering.
3. Choose a good background and lighting. Natural light works great in many cases so try to take photos earlier in the day.
4. Take photos with multiple angles of the item. Include the tag and details of the fabric, as well as any flaws on the item.
5. You can post-edit the photos to make them look more flattering. Keep in mind that the colors should still be accurate! Avoid any photo filters that have a colored tint or vignette.
6. Upload the photos through the app or on the computer. I personally like to post items in batches and it's so much faster to type and navigate on my computer than on my phone. 
7. Use keywords when choosing the title and description of your listings such as size, brand, style, color, quality.

#### How do I price an item?

Search up what the original price of the item was, or try to search for similar items on Poshmark to see how much other listings are.

## Focus on sales strategies

You've done the work of listing your items, now you just need to manage your sales! Here are a few sales strategies I think all Poshmark sellers should use.

#### Share, share, share!

The MOST important thing that impacts your sales is how often you share your items. You can share your item by selecting the little arrow icon at the bottom of your listings. What this does is it boosts your listing to the top of search results. If you're selling a camo Nike long sleeve and recently shared it, then someone who searched for "camo nike long sleeve" likely will find your item at the top of their search results. 

Many sellers share each of their entire closets several times a day. However, this is so tedious and time consuming, so I made a solution for it.

Another thing you could do if an item is getting stale is to relist that item. That takes a bit of time as well but no worries, I'm working on a solution for that too! :) 

#### Always counteroffer lowball offers

I know, it's always disappointing and maybe even offensive when you know you have a great product and list something at $45 then receive an offer on it for $8. Maybe your first reaction will be to not even give this person the time of day. However, objectively you could be passing up on a potentially good business opportunity. I suggest responding with a reasonable counteroffer, or even state that your price is firm. Sometimes, buyers just are trying to find the best deal and just want to see what reaction you would give to their offer. Some buyers are still open-minded on the pricing.

#### When it comes to customer service, all the small things matter

Small gestures go a long way. For example, try to respond to comments as soon as you can. Or if it's a long holiday weekend, give your buyer a really quick message that the post office is closed that weekend so it'll ship the next business day. Even just including a short handwritten thank you note in your package can go a long way in improving the purchase experience for the buyer.

## Ship out the item

Once your item sells, Poshmark sends you a prepaid USPS label which you can print out and stick onto the packaged item. You can then either give the package to the mailman or drop it off at the closest USPS stores or dropbox. 

You can actually get free USPS supplies online by going to [their website](https://store.usps.com/store/results/shipping-supplies/_/N-7d0v8v) and order them online. On that note, it's totally okay to reuse packaging like Amazon envelopes or boxes.

Once the item has been delivered, the buyer will confirm the item is as described and sometimes leaves a review or love note. You'll get the funds from the sale deposited into your bank account in around 3 business days. 

#### What should I do with my Poshmark earnings?

If you're serious about reselling, you can reinvest your earnings back into your business and repeat the sales cycle again. But this time, you'll have more knowledge on what pieces sell faster.


**In conclusion**, the biggest thing you can do is actually taking action. This is your calling!
